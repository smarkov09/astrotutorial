The **France national rugby union team** colloquially known as _Le XV de France_

Rugby was introduced to France in 1872 by the British before a first French national squad was formed in 1893 (as a selection of the best Parisian-club players under the USFSA governance) to face a club in England. A few years later, on New Year's Day 1906, the national side played its first test match against New Zealand in Paris. France then played sporadically against the Home Nations until they joined them in 1910 to form the Five Nations Championship. France also competed in the rugby competitions at early Summer Olympics, winning the gold medal in 1900 and two silver medals in the 1920s. The national team came of age during the 1950s and 1960s, winning their first Five Nations title outright in 1959. They won their first Grand Slam in 1968. Their last win in the tournament dates back to 2022 under head coach and former team-captain Fabien Galthi√©, who is currently in charge of the selection.
